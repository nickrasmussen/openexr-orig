ABOUT THE OPENEXR LIBRARIES
----------------------------

PyIlmBase is our python bindings for Imath and the other libraries
in the IlmBase library.

LICENSE

The OpenEXR source code distribution is free software.  See the file
named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.


BUILDING PYILMBASE
------------------

Building OpenEXR requires IlmBase and the boost library.

You can obtain the source code for boost from:

   http://www.boost.org

After installing the required libraries, to build PyIlmBase on
GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do this:

./configure
make
make install

unless you obtained OpenEXR directly from github, in which case you
should first read README.GIT.

Do `make check` to run the PyIlmBase confidence tests.  They should all
pass; if you find a test that does not pass on your system, please let
us know.

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting PyIlmBase to a particular
platform.
